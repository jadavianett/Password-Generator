# Password Generator 

## About 
Welcome to my Password Generator Repository! Using the given starter code, I have created a responsive password generator that will randomly generate a password that meets the user-selected requirements and assignment acceptance criteria. 

## Javascript Layout
This assignment relied heavily on Javascript. In order to meet the acceptance criteria, I utilized functions, variables, if/else statements, alerts, confirms, prompts, returns, and functions! At the end of the day, my password generator presents a series of prompts for password criteria, holds all user input and then generates a password based on that user input that is displayed on the page. 

In order to achieve this, I first pseudo coded the project to include all of the steps that I would later need to write code for. After pseudo coding, I created my variables to store character information and the available characters that would be chosen from to make the final password. From there, I was able to add if/else statements and a function that executed the desired result. 

I organized these elements by generally listing my variables first and then my if/else statements. Comments are throughout the code to describe what each chunk of code is executing. 

## Challenges
This was a difficult assignment for me. To be completely transparent, I was quite stumped after pseudo coding and adding in my variables.Thankfully, my tutor was able to help me think through the remainder of the processes. One challenge to working through with a tutor was forgetting to commit along the way! I will definitely be sure to commit early and commit often on the next assignment.
